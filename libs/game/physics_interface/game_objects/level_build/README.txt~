To add a new game object to the level_builder do  things:
1. Subclass GameObject, implementing the methods necessary for the particular object O.
2. Add a method to the physics_interface that creates an instance of O.
3. Add a feature (either a button or a drawing behavior) to the drawingtoolkit that calls that physics_interface method as its callback.
